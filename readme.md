# CAD201en - Developing Cloud Native Applications

### edX.org online course (CAD201EN) - 6 module course

### Welcome

### Course Overview

In this course, you will get an overview and grounding in Cloud Native and DevOps practices. You will become familiar with tools and services for continuous delivery and deployment of applications on the Cloud.   
This course contains several hands-on labs that will enable you to practice what you learn with Cloud based tools and services in a no-charge IBM Cloud account.    
You will also understand how REST APIs work and their JSON data format. Moreover, you’ll interact with examples of using REST APIs with IBM Watson AI services. And as a modern developer, you will utilize a Web IDE and Git to create and manage your code.    
Furthermore, you will create and deploy a Node.js application on Cloud, that uses REST APIs to store and access data in a NoSQL Cloudant database.

### Who is this course intended for?

Anyone and everyone who wants to start building cloud applications - whether you are starting a career as a Cloud Application Developer (e.g. Developers, Systems/Cloud Architects, Technical Leads, Data Engineers, Security Engineers, Consultants, Technical Sellers, etc.) or you are looking to learn more about the technologies used in building, deploying and maintaining cloud applications.
